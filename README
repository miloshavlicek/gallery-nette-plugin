=== Gallery Nette Plugin ===
Author: Martin Å tekl <martin.stekl@gmail.com>

== Description ==
Plugin helps to create galleries of photos. (In code there it is called groups and items.)

This is built for PHP 5.2+ and based on Nette Framerwork 2.0.

== Dependencies ==
It depends on Nette Framework, dibi and MultipleFileUploader (Nette Plugin).

Note: Database layer can be replaced in model. MultipleFileUploader is optional
but recomanded.

== Installation ==

1) Copy all files into folder with your project (libs).

2a) Install all database tables into your database. If it is needed change model.
	Default database structure is in /model/mysql.sql

2b) If you want to add more columns you have to add it into *_extended table.
    Basic table is for basic data only. Plugin is sensitive to basic table
    structure.

3) Create service for GalleryEnvironment. The easiest way is add service in startup
   function in your BasePresenter.
   To create service "gallery" write this:
   
   $this->context->addService('gallery', 'GalleryEnvironment::getInstance');
   
   Note: "gallery" in config.neon is fixed label, service name can be changed.

4) Configure your gallery environment in config.neon.

== Notes ==
In example templates is used fancybox javascript library for photogalleries and 
fugue icons. Tepmplates should be changed/replaced for using in your own project.

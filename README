Plugin helps to create galleries of photos. (In code there it is called groups and items.)

This is built for PHP 5.2+ and based on Nette Framerwork 2.0.

It depends on Nette Framework, dibi and MultipleFileUploader (Nette Plugin).

Note: Database layer can be replaced in model. MultipleFileUploader is optional
but recomanded.

== Installation ==

1a) Copy all files into folder with your project (libs).

1b) If you want to add more columns you have to add it into *_extended table.
    Basic table is for basic data only. Plugin is sensitive to basic table
    structure.

2) Install all database tables into your database. If it is needed change model.

== Notes ==
In example templates is used fancybox javascript library for photogalleries and 
fugue icons. Tepmplates should be changed/replaced for using in your own project.
